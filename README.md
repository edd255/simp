# Simple Image Manipulation Program
At university, I have implemented the seam carving algorithm in C as a project for a programming lecture. To familiarize myself with Rust, I've reimplemented the algorithm in Rust, and added more image processing methods. The projects supports the following manipulations:
* Rotating
* Cropping
* Inverting
* Transposing
* Mirroring
* Seam Carving (vertically and horizontically)
* Landfilling

As this project was intended to learn Rust, this project will not be updated anymore.
