# Simple Image Manipulation Program
At university, I implemented seam carving in C for a lecture. Now I plan to
program the project in Rust, and add more image processing methods to
familiarize myself with the language.

Currently, some basic features as rotating, cropping, inverting colors are
implemented, well as the a bit more advanced feature of seam carving. The
repository is now in maintenance mode. No new features are added until the
existing code is sufficiently tested and documented.
